Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.\nIn the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.\nPlace a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).\nPour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.\nCook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.\nI usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.\nTo keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.\nSo, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.\nWhen you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","localizedName":"blender","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/blender.png"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","localizedName":"milk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/milk.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404764,"name":"pastry brush","localizedName":"pastry brush","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pastry-brush.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan.
