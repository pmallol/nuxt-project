The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened.

really well and place them in a stock pot.\nTo the chicken in the pot, add the water (water should mostly cover the chicken), bouillon, bay leaf, onion, bell pepper and garlic.\nPlace the stock pot over medium high heat and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove pot from the heat.\nRemove chicken quarters

You only need to cook them for about 9 minutes. They'll finish cooking in the oven, later. After the 9 minutes, take them out and drain them face down on a paper towel. You don't want an excess water in the shell!\nWhile the noodles are cooking, work on your filling. Cook some frozen spinach in the microwave until it's no longer frozen. I'd recommend following the directions on the box, but don't add in any water. Once the spinach is cooked, add to the spinach, wheat germ, parmesan cheese, Mexican (the original recipe called for cheddar) shredded cheese, chopped pecans, and finely diced green onions. Mix until combined. Add in salt, a touch of pepper, and dried basil, to taste. I used about  teaspoon of dried basil, but feel free to use as much as you like. The sisters also suggest adding nutmeg, to taste, if you like!\nOnce the mixture is seasoned to your liking, add in two eggs and water and mix again until the eggs have been fully incorporated!\nNow stuff the mixture into each of the shells. You should have enough of the spinach filling to make about 16 - 20 shells. Set these aside.\nTake an 8 x 8 pan (you could also use a 9 x 13) and grease it with cooking spray. Now spread alfredo sauce on the bottom, you'll use about  of a jar. Spread spaghetti sauce on top of that. Use a spatula to spread it evenly on the bottom of the pan. Top the sauces with the shells. Use the remaining sauce to top the shells.\nBake in a preheated 350 degree oven, uncovered, for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and serve!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by pre-boiling your jumbo shells in a large pot of boiling salted water.
